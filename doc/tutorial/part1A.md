# Part 1A: Our first implementation of the digital FIR filter

**Part 1A** is our first implementation of the digital FIR filter. Much of the
code found in subsequent stages will resemble the code found here.

In **Part 1A** the FIR filter is implemented in a very simple but not very
efficient way. The input samples, filter coefficients and output samples are all
`double` values. All filter arithmetic is done in double-precision, which
maximizes the arithmetic precision, but comes at a steep performance cost, as
not much can be done to accelerate this work in hardware.

Additionally, the filter logic in this stage is implemented in plain C. This is
a useful starting point because many users approach xcore.ai with their
algorithms implemented in plain C for the sake of portability.

Using `double` arithmetic to implement the filter on a low cost microcontroller
is an unrealistically bad idea. Hence, it is not an ideal anchor to judge the
performance of the implementations in subsequent stages against (**Part 1B**
provides a better reference). However, it is still useful to demonstrate just
how large a penalty the application suffers for this.

## Implementation

The [Software Organization](sw_organization.md) page discussed the broad
structure of the firmware. [Common Code](common.md) briefly reviews some of the
elements common to all stages. This page will zoom in and take the point-of-view
of the `filter_task` thread in **Part 1A**, which actually does the filtering.

The code specific to **Part 1A** is found in `part1A.c`.

**Part 1A** uses the filter coefficients from `filter_coef_double.c`.

```{literalinclude} ../../src/part1A/part1A.c

language: C
start-after: +filter_task
end-before: -filter_task
---
```

This is the filtering thread's entry-point. After initialization this function
loops forever, receiving a frame of input audio, processing it to get output
audio, and then transmitting it back to `tile[0]` to be written to the output
`wav` file.

`filter_task()` takes a channel end resource as a parameter. This is how it 
communicates with `wav_io_task`.

`sample_history[]` is the buffer which stores the previously received input
samples. The samples in this buffer are stored in reverse chronological order,
with the most recently received sample at `sample_history[0]`.

`frame_output[]` is the buffer into to which computed output samples are placed
before being sent to `wav_io_task`.

The `filter_task` thread loops until the application is terminated (via
`tile[0]`). In each iteration of its main loop, the first step is to receive
`FRAME_SIZE` new input samples and place them into the sample history buffer (in
reverse order) (see `rx_frame()` below).

After receiving (and converting) the frame of new samples, `filter_task`
computes `FRAME_SIZE` new output samples, each the result of a call to
`filter_sample()`.

The last thing to do before sending the frame of computed output samples back to
`wav_io_task` on `tile[0]` (see `tx_frame()`) is to shift the contents of the
`sample_history[]` buffer to make room for the next frame of input audio. This
allows the samples to stay fully ordered.

Finally, the output frame is sent to `tile[0]` and it repeats the loop.

```{literalinclude} ../../src/part1A/part1A.c
---
language: C
start-after: +filter_sample
end-before: -filter_sample
---
```

`filter_sample()` is the function where individual output sample values are
computed. It is where most of the work is actually done.

Each call to `filter_sample()` produces exactly one output sample, and so a call
to `filter_sample()` corresponds to a particular time step, and that requires
the most recent `TAP_COUNT` input sample values leading up to (and including)
that time step. The input parameter `sample_history[]` then needs to point to
the main sample history buffer, offset according to the current sample within
the current frame.

A double-precision accumulator is initialized to zero, and the inner product of
the sample history and filter coefficient vectors is computed in a simple `for`
loop.

`filter_coef[]`, the vector of filter coefficients, is represented by a
`TAP_COUNT`-element array of `double`s, where every element is set to the value
$\frac{1}{1024} = 0.0009765625$.

```c
const double filter_coef[TAP_COUNT] = { ... };
```

```{literalinclude} ../../src/part1A/part1A.c
---
language: C
start-after: +rx_frame
end-before: -rx_frame
---
```

`rx_frame()` accepts a frame of audio data over a channel. Note that to
demonstrate a fully floating-point implementation, we would ideally be directly
receiving our sample data as `double` values, but that would complicate things
for little benefit, so instead we are just converting the received PCM samples
into `double` values as we receive them.

`rx_frame()` places the (`double`) sample values into the buffer it was given in
reverse chronological order, as is expected by `filter_sample()`.


---

```{literalinclude} ../../src/part1A/part1A.c
---
language: C
start-after: +tx_frame
end-before: -tx_frame
---
```

`tx_frame()` mirrors `rx_frame()`. It takes in a frame's worth of
`double`-valued  output audio samples, converts each to the appropriate 32-bit
PCM value, and then sends them to the `wav_io` thread via a channel. Note that
unlike `rx_frame()` this function does _not_ reorder the samples being sent.
