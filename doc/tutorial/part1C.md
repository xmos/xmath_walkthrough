# Part 1C: Introducing a vector operation

Like [**Part 1B**](part1B.md), **Part 1C** implements the FIR filter using
single-precision floating-point arithmetic. However, instead of implementing the
inner product directly with a plain C loop, **Part 1C** makes a call to a
library function, `vect_f32_dot()` provided by `lib_xcore_math`.

Rather than relying on the compiler to produce fast floating-point logic,
`vect_f32_dot()` was hand-written in optimized XS3 assembly to go as quickly as
possible. Here we expect to see another significant performance boost.

One of the main reasons for this speed-up is that the C compiler does not, by default, emit dual-issue implementations of C functions. Dual-issue code often allows inner loops to be significantly shortened, usually at the cost of program size.

## From `lib_xcore_math`

This stage makes use of the following operations from `lib_xcore_math`:

* [`vect_f32_dot()`](https://github.com/xmos/lib_xcore_math/blob/v2.1.1/lib_xcore_math/api/xmath/vect/vect_s32.h#L399-L480)

### `vect_f32_dot()`

```C
C_API
float vect_f32_dot(
    const float b[],
    const float c[],
    const unsigned length);
```

`vect_s32_dot()` takes two `float` vectors, `b[]` and `c[]` (each with `length`
elements), multiplies them together element-wise, and then sums up the products.
The result should be the same as the C implementation of `filter_sample()` from
**Part1B**, only a lot faster.


## Implementation

**Part 1C** uses the exact same implementation as **Part 1B** for
`filter_task()`, `rx_frame()` and `tx_frame()`. The only change is the
implementation of `filter_sample()`.

---

```{literalinclude} ../../src/part1C/part1C.c
---
language: C
start-after: +filter_sample
end-before: -filter_sample
---
```

Whereas **Part 1B** implemented `filter_sample()` by looping over the filter
taps, **Part 1C** instead just makes a call to `vect_f32_dot()` from
`lib_xcore_math`.
